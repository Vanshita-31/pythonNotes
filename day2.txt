Identifier :
A name in python program is called identifier.
variable name 
class name
function name - outside the class 
method name - defined in the class 

x=10
def f1():
	print('f1 function')
class Test:
	def m1(self):
		print('m1 method')
		
what are the identifier in this?

Rules to define identifier in python :
1. The only allowed characters
a to z , A to Z , 0 to 9 , _ (underscore)(only allowed)

cash=1000
ca$h=1000
cash_amount=1000

2. identifier should not start with digit
total123=1000
123total=1000 -- invalid

3. Python identifies are case sensitive 
total=10
Total=20
TOTAL=30

4. no length limit for variable name, but not recommended to take too lengthy identifiers.

5. we cannot use keyword or reserved words as identifiers
x=10
if=20 // keyword or reserved word

Q. WHich of the following are valid python identifier?

123total
total123
java2share
ca$h
_abc_abc_
def
if 
class

***Note :
x -> normal / public variable
_x -> protected variable 
__x -> private variable

******************************
not recommended to use this
__x__ -> language level predefined name/magical name
__name__
__add__
__doc__
__main__

Reserved words:
---------------
somewords are reserved to represent some functionality or meaning 
A --> apple 
apple is reserved word for fruit

We have 35 reserved words
True,False,None
and,or,not,is 
if,elif,else
while,for,break,continue,return,in,yield
try,except,finally,raise,assert
import,from,as,class,def,pass,global,nonlocal,lambda,del,with
async,await

keyword ==> module name
kwlist ==> variable name
import keyword
keyword.kwlist

1. All reserved words contain only alphabets symbols
2. The only reserved words contains upper case alphabet symbols -- True,False,None ==> Values/Reserved literals (can be assigned to the variables) (reserved literals)
3. switch statement is not applicable in python
4. do-while loop is not there
5. no keywords like int,float etc

Reserved literal : can represent some value
keyword : represents some functionality
